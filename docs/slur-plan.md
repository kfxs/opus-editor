# Slurs — Implementation Plan

Status: **Phases 0–3 COMMITTED; Phase 4 deferred.** This document is the authoritative plan and
cross-session checklist. The create-vs-delete correction (no `s` toggle) is **resolved** as of Phase 2.
The core feature is complete; Phase 4 is optional polish.

Slurs are a **phrasing** mark and are a fundamentally different kind of data from **ties** (which
are a *duration* mark). The two must stay separate — the same separation every major program and
the MusicXML standard enforce. This plan adds slurs as a **first-class span object**, anchored to a
start note and an end note, **voice-scoped from day one** (only voice 0 exists today, but the data
and code paths are correct when voices arrive).

Goal of this first pass is to **build the infrastructure** and the core UX, not the full set of
slur-editing niceties (draggable control-point handles, nesting numbers, etc. are deferred).

---

## 1. Goal

Let the user draw a slur over a run of notes/chords in a single voice:

- **`s`, single note selected** → slur from the current note to the **next slot** (note *or* rest),
  reusing the same "next slot" logic `MusicEngine.toggleTie` already uses (`MusicEngine.ts:838`).
- **`s`, range selected** → slur from the **first** to the **last** element in **score order**
  (`measure`, then `beat`) — *not* selection order.
- **`s` is create-only and idempotent** (user decision, 2026-06-13): pressing it again on a span that
  already carries a slur returns the existing slur and adds nothing — it does **not** toggle off. (This
  replaced the original "toggle off on repeat" plan; see the resolved correction note under Phase 1.)
- A slur is **selectable** (click its arc in selection mode) and **deletable** (Delete) — removal lives
  **only** in the select+Delete path, not on `s` — with a scoped highlight, just like ties.
- Undo/redo + JSON round-trip throughout.

`s` is lowercase and is **not** a note-entry letter (only `a`–`g` are), so it is safe; it operates on
the current selection (a selection-mode action).

### Voice rule
A slur lives **within a single voice** — you never slur from one voice to another. The `Slur`
carries an explicit `voice` field (mirroring `Dynamic.voice` / `Note.voice`). **When a range
selection spans more than one voice, only the primary voice (`voice 0`, musician's "voice 1") is
slurred; notes in other voices are ignored.** Both anchors must be in the same voice.

### Non-goals (this pass)
- Playback effect — a slur is **notational only** for now (no legato re-articulation change). May add
  legato interpretation later.
- Draggable control-point handles / manual curve shaping (the Sibelius "six handles").
- Nested/overlapping slur disambiguation numbers (the field is reserved; see §4).

### 2.1 Tie vs slur — universally separate
|              | Tie                              | Slur                                       |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Connects     | 2 heads, **same pitch**          | a **range** of N events, any pitch         |
| Meaning      | one sustained sound (duration)   | phrasing / legato (articulation)           |
| Spans        | adjacent slots                   | arbitrary; may **nest / overlap**          |
| Anchors to   | individual pitch (notehead)      | the **note event / chord** as a whole      |
| Playback     | merges durations                 | at most legato; usually notational only    |

- **MusicXML:** tie = `<tie type="start"/>` (sound) + `<tied>` (notation). Slur = `<slur
  type="start" number="N"/>` … `<slur type="stop" number="N"/>` attached to the start/end notes, with
  a **`number` (1–6)** to disambiguate overlapping/nested slurs and optional `placement="above|below"`.
- **MuseScore:** `Slur` is a **Spanner** with `startElement` / `endElement` (anchored to Chord/Note);
  ties are a different class on `Note`. Not the same code path.
- **Sibelius:** slurs are **Lines** (a span between two rhythmic positions); ties are note
  properties. Matches the user's mental model.

**Takeaway:** model a slur as a **span object referencing a start anchor and an end anchor**, with
`placement` + a reserved `number`. Do **not** model it as note attributes (that's correct for ties).

### 2.2 System-break behavior (Gould / Sibelius)
When a slur crosses a **system break** (the music wraps to the next row), it is **never** stretched
as one arc. It is drawn as **two half-arcs**: the first **trails off** the right end of the upper
system; the second begins at the **left** of the next system and curves into the end note. This is
exactly the convention — and exactly the two-partial mechanism the tie renderer already implements
for cross-line ties (`VexFlowRenderer.ts:2094`). Sibelius creates this by selecting the run and
pressing **`s`** (same gesture we're adopting) and exposes six draggable handles afterward (deferred).

## 3. Codebase findings (why this slots in cleanly)

- **Ties are the structural anti-pattern to avoid copying, but the right *rendering/selection*
  precedent.** Ties live on the note (`tiedTo`/`tiedFrom`, `types/music.ts:174`) because they connect
  same-pitch heads. Slurs must **not** copy that — they get a dedicated object. But the *machinery*
  around ties is reusable verbatim:
  - **Rendering:** `VexFlowRenderer.renderTies` (`:2032`) is called once after all measures draw
    (`:1703`); it walks the score, looks up endpoints in `staveNoteMap` (keyed by **NotePitch id and
    rest id** — so a head id resolves straight to its chord's StaveNote), draws arcs, and **registers**
    each in the `ElementRegistry` as a `'tie'` element with a bbox. `renderSlurs` mirrors the *walk +
    register* structure. **Caveat — don't assume the `Curve` path:** the same-line case is **not**
    drawn with `StaveTie`; it is hand-drawn on the canvas context by `drawFlatTie` (`:1991`), which
    returns a *computed* bbox. `StaveTie` is used only for the cross-line partials. **VexFlow ships a
    `Curve` class** (confirmed present in our build, `Curve extends Element`, takes `from`/`to` Notes
    + control points + an `openingDirection`), but two gaps make a hand-drawn `drawFlatSlur` the
    safer default (see Phase 1):
    1. **Bbox reliability** — the registry needs a bbox for hit-testing. `Element.getBoundingBox()`
       exists, but it is **not confirmed** that `Curve.draw()` populates it; must be verified or the
       bbox derived from the two notes' pixel extents.
    2. **Two different Ys** — slurs span *different pitches*, so endpoints have different Y. `drawFlatTie`
       hardcodes a single Y (`:2000–2001`); a slur arc must take both endpoint Ys.
  - **Selection:** `SelectionItem` already reserves `{ kind: 'tie'; fromNoteId }`
    (`selection.ts:21`); add `{ kind: 'slur'; id }`. `EditorState.selectedTieFromNoteId`
    (`EditorState.ts:54`) → add `selectedSlurId`.
  - **Highlight (do NOT reuse `colorTieArc` verbatim):** `HighlightController.applyTieHighlight` +
    `colorTieArc` (`:259`, `:302`) recolor by scanning **every `<path>` whose center falls inside the
    registered bbox**. That is safe for a tiny tie arc, but a slur bbox spanning several notes is a
    large rectangle — the scan would recolor beams (which are paths), other arcs, and ties inside the
    span. This is exactly the highlight-bleed class already fixed elsewhere by scoping recolor to an
    element's own SVG group (see docs/note-selection-hit-detection.md). `applySlurHighlight` must
    therefore color the slur's **own `Curve`/SVG group/element**, not do a bbox path-scan.
  - **ElementRegistry:** `ElementType` union (`ElementRegistry.ts:18`) add `'slur'`; reuse the
    tie-style fields (`fromNoteId`, `toNoteId`, `fromMeasure`, `toMeasure`, `isPartial`, `partialType`).
- **Voice-readiness already exists:** `Note.voice` / `Chord.voice` / `Rest.voice` default 0; the
  `Dynamic.voice` field (`types/music.ts:119`) is the idiom a `Slur.voice` follows. No-op today.
- **Score-order sort already exists:** `toggleTie` sorts all slots by `(measure, beat)`
  (`MusicEngine.ts:838`) — reuse for first/last endpoint resolution and for filtering to voice 0.
- **Multi-select set is in place:** `EditorState.selectedItems: Map<string, SelectionItem>`
  (`EditorState.ts:28`) + `selectedNoteIds` (`selection.ts:59`) give the range the `s` handler reads.
- **Shortcut plumbing:** `SHORTCUTS` (`ShortcutConfig.ts`) maps keys → action names; `'s'` is unused.
  Add `'s' → 'toggleSlur'`, handler in the controller layer (`PaletteController.toggleTie` at `:148`
  is the precedent), routed through `useShortcuts`.
- **Serialization:** `Score.schemaVersion === 2`; new top-level `slurs?` array is optional → old JSON
  loads with no slurs. No breaking migration.

### Storage decision
Slurs are stored as a **top-level `Score.slurs: Slur[]`** (not measure-owned). Rationale: slurs cross
barlines and systems freely; ties already dodge measure-ownership (they live on notes) precisely
*because* they span measures. A flat score-level array is the simplest thing that handles
cross-measure spans, and `renderSlurs` walks it the same way `renderTies` walks the whole score.
(Measure-owned, like `dynamics`/`clefs`, was considered and rejected — ownership of a span that
leaves its measure is awkward for rebar/paste.)

## 4. Data model

```ts
/** A phrasing slur spanning a run of note events within one voice. */
export interface Slur {
  id: string
  /** Anchor: the start note's head id (a NotePitch id, as used by selection). */
  startNoteId: string
  /** Anchor: the end note's head id. */
  endNoteId: string
  /** Voice this slur belongs to; both anchors share it. Default 0. */
  voice?: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3
  /** Vertical placement; default auto (derived from stem direction). */
  placement?: 'above' | 'below'
  /**
   * Reserved for future nested/overlapping-slur disambiguation (MusicXML `number`).
   * Unused in this pass.
   */
  number?: number
}
```

- Add `slurs?: Slur[]` to `Score` (`types/music.ts`). Optional/absent = no slurs.
- **Anchor granularity:** anchors are **head ids (NotePitch ids)** — the id the selection system
  hands us, and the key `staveNoteMap` uses — but at render time each is resolved to its **containing
  chord's StaveNote**, since a slur arcs over the whole event, not one pitch of a chord.
- **Anchor fragility (head id vs. event).** A slur is an *event-level* mark, but we store a *head* id.
  The model does carry a stable event id (`Chord.id` / `Rest.id`), but `staveNoteMap` is keyed by head
  id, not chord id — so head-id anchors are the pragmatic choice. The cost is two cleanup obligations
  (handled in Phase 2, not the type):
  - **Chord-sibling deletion:** deleting one head of a multi-note chord (chord survives) orphans a slur
    anchored to that head → **re-anchor to a surviving sibling head of the same chord**.
  - **Single-note deletion:** `deleteNote` replaces a deleted single note with a **brand-new rest id**
    (`MusicEngine.ts:893`) and re-points the *tie* to it (`:902–905`). A slur anchored there must do the
    same re-point, or be dropped — it will **not** survive automatically.
  - **Rebar/paste:** these mostly *preserve* note ids, so slurs survive bar reflow on their own. The real
    hazards are delete / overwrite-paste / tie-merge (above), not rebar movement.

## 5. Phases

Each phase is independently shippable and ends green (unit tests + manual check by the user).

### Phase 0 — Types & serialization (no behavior) — DONE (not committed)
- [x] Add `Slur` interface + `Score.slurs?: Slur[]` (`types/music.ts`).
- [x] `'slur'` added to `ElementType` (`ElementRegistry.ts`) and `SelectionItem`
      (`selection.ts`, `itemKey` — folded into the `id`-keyed case group).
- [x] `EditorState.selectedSlurId: string | null` (`EditorState.ts`), default null. (Clear-sites
      deferred to Phase 2 — nothing sets it until then, so it stays null.)
- [x] JSON export/import round-trips `slurs` automatically (top-level field on `Score`; `toJSON`/
      `fromJSON` stringify/parse the whole score — no migration; old JSON → `slurs` undefined, treated
      as `[]` by consumers).
- [x] Unit tests for the round-trip + legacy backward-compat (`ScoreModel.test.ts`).
- 605 unit tests green; `npm run build:check` passes.

### Phase 1 — Create / toggle via `s` (same-line only) — DONE & COMMITTED (d629a64)

> **✅ POST-IMPLEMENTATION CORRECTION (user, 2026-06-13) — RESOLVED in Phase 2.**
> The user does **not** want toggle semantics on `s`. Phase 1 shipped the interim toggle-off; Phase 2
> replaced it with **create vs. delete as distinct operations**: `toggleSlur` → **`createSlur`**
> (create-only, idempotent — returns the existing slur on a repeat, never removes); removal lives only
> in the select-the-arc + Delete path (`removeSlur`). The toggle-off test was replaced by an
> idempotency test. No remaining action.

- [x] `MusicEngine.createSlur(noteIds: string[])` — resolves endpoints:
  - single note → current note → next slot (note or rest), via `nextDistinctSlot` which **dedupes to
    distinct `(measure, beat)` slots** (skips sibling chord heads at the same beat).
  - range → first/last in score order, **filtered to voice 0**.
  - if a slur with the same endpoints exists → returns it unchanged (**idempotent, create-only**).
- [x] One atomic undo step ("Add slur"), `saveUndoState`. (Removal's "Remove slur" undo step lives in
      `removeSlur`, Phase 2.)
- [x] `'s' → 'createSlur'` in `ShortcutConfig`; `PaletteController.createSlur` handler +
      `useShortcuts` wiring (reads `selectedItems`, falls back to scalar `selectedNoteId`).
- [x] `renderSlurs` (called after `renderTies` in the post-measure pass), registered in
      `ElementRegistry` as `'slur'` with a bbox + sampled arc `points`. Used a hand-drawn
      **`drawFlatSlur`** (both endpoint Ys, computed bbox) — `Curve` avoided. Same-line only;
      cross-system spans are skipped (Phase 3).
- [x] Unit tests: endpoint resolution (single / range / score-order / chord next-slot dedupe /
      no-next-slot → null), idempotency, undo+redo. `build:check` passes.

### Phase 2 — Select / highlight / delete — DONE & COMMITTED (adcfaaf)
- [x] Hit-test the slur in selection mode → set `selectedSlurId`. Used **arc-proximity** (min distance
      to the sampled `points` ≤ 7px), not bbox containment — so clicking the curve selects it without
      the coarse rectangle swallowing clicks on the spanned notes. (`MouseController`, after the tie
      hit-test.) Note: routed through the scalar `selectedSlurId`, not `selectedItems`, matching the
      other non-note marks (ties/dynamics/clefs) — multi-select migration is a later phase.
- [x] `HighlightController.applySlurSelectionHighlight` — colors **the slur's own `<g class="vf-slur">`
      group** (via `getSlurSVGGroup`), not a bbox path-scan, so no bleed onto beams/arcs in the span.
      Wired into `RenderController.applyHighlights`.
- [x] Delete removes the `Slur` object (not the notes) via `removeSlur`; one undo step. Wired into
      `useShortcuts` `deleteSelected` (after the tie branch).
- [x] Anchored-note hazards (`MusicEngine.deleteNote` → `reanchorSlurs`): (a) multi-note chord survives
      → re-anchor to a surviving sibling head; (b) single note → re-point onto the replacement rest's
      **new id**; (c) rest deleted / span collapses → drop the slur.
- [x] Unit tests: create-only idempotency, removeSlur+undo, anchor-deletion cleanup (both
      chord-sibling and replacement-rest re-point). 613 tests green.

### Phase 3 — System-break (two-half) rendering — DONE & COMMITTED (2263374)
- [x] When endpoints land on different systems, draw **two partial curves**: first trails off the
      start system's right edge (`fromStave.getNoteEndX()`), second leads in from the end system's left
      edge (`toStave.getNoteStartX()`). `drawFlatSlur` was generalized into `strokeSlurCrescent(p0, cp,
      p1, dir)`; `renderSlurs` computes same-line vs cross-line geometry and calls it once (full) or
      twice (halves). Both partials registered as `'slur'` with `isPartial`/`partialType`.
- [x] Highlight + hit-test both halves as one logical slur: both halves are drawn inside the **same**
      `<g class="vf-slur">` group (recolored together) and each carries arc `points` under the same
      slur `id` (clicking either half selects the slur; Delete removes the one `Slur`).
- [ ] Visual check with a wrapped phrase (manual — renderer geometry isn't unit-testable; 613 unit
      tests + `build:check` green).

### Phase 4 (deferred, not a blocker)
- [x] Auto `placement` from stem direction (DONE & COMMITTED 175c52b): default follows the stems
      notehead-side — stems up → slur below, stems down → slur above (`renderSlurs` reads
      `getStemDirection()` of the start note; explicit `placement` override still wins). Uses the start
      note's stem for the whole slur (incl. both cross-system halves); a full-run vote is a later nicety.
- [x] Optional legato playback interpretation (DONE & COMMITTED 6f1bb23): **zero-regression / additive** —
      `utils/slurs.legatoChordIds(score)` marks chords that connect forward under a slur (start..end-1,
      chords only); `PlaybackEngine` extends those notes by a small overlap (`LEGATO_OVERLAP_BEATS`
      0.12, capped at half the base duration) so they bind to the next onset. Notes outside any slur
      are untouched. Pure util unit-tested (4 cases); the audio path itself isn't unit-testable.
      (Subtle by design — the synth is already near-gapless. If a stronger legato/detached contrast is
      wanted later, introduce a default detachment for non-slurred notes — a global feel change, so
      left as an opt-in.)
- [ ] Draggable control-point handles; nested-slur `number` disambiguation. (Not started — large
      interactive UI; deferred.)

## 6. Decisions locked (from user)
1. **Key:** lowercase **`s`**.
2. **Single note + `s`:** slur current note → next slot (note or rest).
3. **Range + `s`:** first → last in **score order**. `s` is **create-only / idempotent** (no toggle-off
   — revised 2026-06-13); removal is select-the-arc + Delete.
4. **Multi-voice range:** slur **only voice 0** ("voice 1"), ignore others.
5. **System break:** draw as **two half-arcs** (Gould / Sibelius convention).
6. **Storage:** top-level `Score.slurs[]`.
7. **Playback:** notational only for now (no audio change).
