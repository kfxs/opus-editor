# `reference/` — the engraving library, kept OFF the repo

**The files beside this one are gitignored and this README is not.** That split is the whole point:
the sources are third-party publications and do not belong in a git history, but *knowing which ones
exist, what each answered, and how to fetch it again* is the part that keeps costing us agent-hours
to rediscover. So the manifest is committed and the bytes are not.

⚠️ **Local research copies.** Nothing here is ours, nothing here gets redistributed, and nothing here
is quoted into user-facing output beyond what a citation needs.

## Why this directory exists at all

Every engraving number in `src/engine/rendering/` is supposed to cite a rule rather than a taste
(`docs/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md`, and the standing instruction that an invented rule *will* be caught).
That only works while the sources are reachable — and on **2026-08-17** the one we had leaned on
hardest stopped being reachable, mid-investigation, having already supplied most of the Gould
quotations now sitting in `docs/slur-plan.md`. Two agents spent a large part of their budget
rediscovering that it was gone. This directory is so the third one does not.

## What is here

| ⭐⭐ `Behind Bars The Definitive Guide to Music Notation (Elaine Gould) (z-library.sk, 1lib.sk, z-lib.sk) (2).pdf` | **Gould, *Behind Bars*, THE WHOLE BOOK** — 696 PDF pages, 249 MB, scanned with an OCR text layer. Added **2026-08-17 16:25**, i.e. *after* the "how to reach Gould" section below was written. ⭐ **This is now the first stop for any Gould question.** What it has answered so far: the BELOW-STAFF LADDER (p. 29 octave signs incl. the whole-system exception; p. 101–102 dynamics go OUTSIDE octave signs, with the drawn correct/incorrect pair; p. 332–333 pedal below all other notation + Table 2's pedal stacking order; p. 337 a drawn `8`-under-`Ped.`-under-`Sost. Ped.` stack). | added by hand, 2026-08-17 |

Slurs at pp. 121–124: placement by stem direction, "starts mid-stem, to the right of the stem", "never cross the beam with a slur", slope follows the phrase. Also: **damper pedal, p. 105** — *"always placed below the grand staff and are usually placed below all other musical elements"* (our second, independent source for the pedal being the outermost family); **octave signs, p. 98** — *"as close to the notes affected as possible"*, `8vb` is *"only a copyist's shorthand and should not be used in engraved music"*, and a drawn example putting the `8va` outside a slur. ⭐ The `.txt` is already extracted — grep it before opening the PDF. | openly hosted: `musescore.org/sites/musescore.org/files/2022-02/EssentialDictionaryOfMusicNotation_0.pdf` |

## ⭐⭐ Gould is ON DISK — how to page into 249 MB without drowning

**Added 2026-08-17.** ⛔ **Read this before the web section below it**, which was written on 2026-08-17
at 12:09, four hours before the book arrived, and which sent one agent at Google Books for a question
the PDF answers directly.

- **⭐ THE PAGE OFFSET: `PDF page = printed page + 20`.** Calibrated against three landmarks — PDF 50 =
  printed 30 (*Across a system break*), PDF 122 = printed 102 (*Dynamics and articulation*), PDF 353 =
  printed 333 (*Piano notation: Pedalling*). 696 PDF pages, printed body runs to ~676.
- **Find the page cheaply, in text.** `pdftotext -f <pdf> -l <pdf> "<file>" -` on a range, or extract
  the whole book once — `pdftotext "<file>" gould.txt` takes ~1 s and yields ~980 KB — and grep that
  **in the scratch dir, never in the repo**. ⚠️ It is OCR: italics, music glyphs and the tables come
  out as noise (`ottavn bassn`, `92w` for `Ped.`), so grep on plain prose words.
- **⛔ The Read tool cannot open this PDF** — "exceeds maximum allowed size for text extraction
  (100MB)". **Render the page to PNG instead** and Read *that*:
  `pdftoppm -f <pdf> -l <pdf> -r 450 -png "<file>" out` (~0.2 s/page at 450 dpi, ~2765×4147 px).
- **⭐⭐ Then MEASURE it.** At 450 dpi one stave-space is **20 px**, so a per-row ink profile over an
  x-window turns any figure into stave-spaces: find the five staff lines (the rows with a huge ink
  count), then read off the rungs below them. That is how p. 102's and p. 337's ladders were measured
  (`docs/`-facing numbers, 2026-08-17). ⛔ `numpy` is not installed — plain PIL `load()` loops are
  fast enough on one page.

## ⭐⭐ How to reach Gould when the PDF is not to hand — the routes that work, and the one that does not

⛔ **`archive.org/details/behind-bars-by-elaine-gould` IS DEAD** (HTTP 200 with an empty `{}`
metadata body = a darkened item; `/download/` 404s, and the stale search index still lists it, which
is what makes agents keep trying). The lending IDs `behindbarsdefini0000goul`, `behindbars0000goul`,
`behindbarsguidet0000goul` are all empty too. **Do not send an agent at it.** Ted Ross
(`artofmusicengrav0000tedr`) went the same way — "Item not available", 403 even on search-inside.

⭐ **Google Books search-within-volume — verbatim text WITH page numbers, and reproducible:**

```
https://books.google.de/books?id=yBK_DwAAQBAJ&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume&num=100&q=<short+term>
```

with a browser User-Agent and `Referer: https://books.google.de/`. Returns
`{page_number, snippet_text}`. Caveats that decide whether it works:

- ✅ **Re-verified live 2026-08-17 ~18:45** (`q=octave+sign`, `q=pedal+line`, `q=pedal+dynamics` all
  returned page-numbered snippets). It is how printed pp. 29 / 101 / 332 were *located* before the
  local PDF was known about — a good index, a poor reader.
- ⛔ **Not** `googleapis.com/books/v1` — quota-exhausted, returns 429.
- ⚠️ **Short terms only.** A long exact phrase returns zero hits; search two or three words and read
  the snippet around them.
- ⚠️ `…` in a snippet is a **real elision** — never quote across one.
- OCR inserts spaces around hyphens (`stave - space`).

⭐ **Third-party page scans, for anything with a picture.** Snippets are prose only; when the
question is *what did she draw*, find a scan. `scoringnotes.com` and the `notat.io` forum (needs a
browser UA — `WebFetch` gets 403) both reproduce printed pages, and notat.io additionally quotes
house styles **with numbers** and Ross with page numbers.

### What was asked of it on 2026-08-17, and what came back

The question was the **below-staff ladder**: does an `8vb` bracket, and does the sustain pedal, sit
inside or outside the dynamics? Recorded here because the answer contradicted our pass order.

| asked | source | answer |
|---|---|---|
| 8vb vs dynamics, below the staff | **Gould p. 101** (prose) | *"other markings — such as those for articulation, slurs, **octave signs** and tuplet brackets — are **required to be closer to notes**, so add these markings to the music **before positioning dynamics**"*. So the bracket is INSIDE. |
| the same, as a PICTURE | **Gould p. 102** (top figure) | The drawn correct/incorrect pair, and it is an ottava **bassa** under the staff with hairpins. Correct: slurs · `8- - -⌐` · `f< sf> p<` outward. **"but not"**: the dynamics tucked under the staff and the `8` pushed outside them. Measured at 450 dpi: dashed line **4.0 sp** below the bottom staff-line, dynamic ink from **≈5.5 sp**. |
| the exception | **Gould p. 29** | *"Place an extension line **for a whole system** outside all other notation (notes, short slurs, articulation and dynamics) … information that potentially changes (e.g. dynamics) is better placed closer to the stave. **Only tempo markings and piano pedal indications remain outside** an octave extension line that continues for a whole system."* ⭐ A whole-system line INVERTS the p. 101 order. |
| pedal vs everything | **Gould p. 332** | *"Place these beneath the lowest stave of the system, **below all other notation including an 8va bassa sign**."* Table 2's order = damper, sostenuto, una corda, staff-outward, *"this reflects their physical layout"*. |
| the same, as a PICTURE | **Gould p. 337** (2nd figure) | `8- - -⌐` under the bass staff, `Ped.` line below it, `Sost. Ped.` line below that. Measured: **3.25 / 7.25 / 10.5 sp** below the bottom staff-line. |
| the same, second source | **Gerou & Lusk p. 105** | *"always placed below the grand staff and are **usually placed below all other musical elements**."* |
| ⛔ pedal vs dynamics **as a picture** | — | **UNKNOWN.** Every pedal figure in Gould pp. 333–338 is piano, where dynamics go *between* the staves (p. 323), so the two never share a side. Only the prose above covers it. |

## ⭐ Adding a source

When a hunt turns up something real, it lands here — and **the row in the table above is the part
that matters**, not the file. A PDF nobody knows we have is worth the same as no PDF.

1. Drop the file in (or a `*-scans/` subdirectory for page images). It is gitignored by the
   `reference/*` + `!reference/README.md` pair in `.gitignore`; nothing further is needed.
2. **Add its row**: what it is, *which questions it actually answered*, and the URL it came from.
   The middle column is the one a future reader searches on — "Gerou & Lusk" means nothing to
   someone looking for whether a slur may cross a beam.
3. If it made a repo claim checkable, or refuted one, say so in the row. That is how
   `docs/slur-plan.md` and the `src/engine/rendering/` doc comments stay honest about *which* source
   each number came from.
4. ⛔ **A scan beats an OCR whenever the question is "what did they DRAW".** Snippet APIs return
   prose only, and a book's engraving can be measured — that is how Gould's p. 111 examples were
   found to disagree with the formula attributed to her. Keep the images.

⚠️ **Do not add something we cannot cite.** A file with no traceable origin is worse than nothing: it
reads as authority and cannot be checked, which is the exact failure mode this whole discipline
exists to prevent.

### ⭐ What an agent SHOULD pick up, and where the budget goes to die

**Take what you legitimately find.** A publicly readable archive.org item, a Google Books volume, a
publisher's sample, a PDF a project hosts openly (which is how we have Gerou & Lusk), a page a
library or a forum reproduces under quotation — use it, keep it, add its row. ⛔ **This directory
existing is not a reason to skip a source you found in passing**; the archive.org copy of *Behind
Bars* was exactly that kind of find, and it carried the slur and hairpin research for two days.

⛔ **What is NOT worth an agent's time is the file-locker sweep.** On 2026-08-17 one agent worked
through idoc.pub, vdoc.pub, kupdf, pdfcoffee, pdfdrive and a row of libgen mirrors looking for
*Behind Bars*. It spent the larger part of a **2.9-million-token, 50-minute** run on it and came back
with **nothing** — while the two routes that actually produced verbatim, page-numbered quotations
that same hour were Google Books and a forum thread. So: if a source is openly and plainly
available, take it; if it is only on mirrors, that is the signal to change tactic, not to keep
digging. The rules we need are answerable from snippets, scans and engravers who own the book.

## Still missing — UNKNOWN, not silent

**Ted Ross** *The Art of Music Engraving*, **Kurt Stone** *Music Notation in the Twentieth Century*,
**Gardner Read** *Music Notation*, **Chlapik** *Die Praxis des Notengraphikers* (no digital copy is
known to exist), and Boosey & Hawkes' house manual. ⛔ When one of these would have answered a
question, the honest report is **UNKNOWN** — never "the books are silent". The single sentence of
Ross we hold is second-hand, relayed by Ruggero on notat.io: *"Long slurs always start and end over
or under the center of a notehead"* (p. 141).

❌ **MOLA's Guidelines for Music Preparation genuinely say nothing** about slurs, ties or hairpins —
verified by extracting the whole PDF twice. Stop checking it.
